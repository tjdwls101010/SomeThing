### TAG Research System Integration

**Research TAGs Used**:

**Research Workflow**:
```
Automation Task → Strategy Selection → Execution Monitoring →
Pattern Analysis → Knowledge Generation → Methodology Update
```

### Performance Monitoring & Optimization

**Playwright Server Health**:
- **Response Time Tracking**: Monitor page navigation and interaction latency
- **Success Rate Analysis**: Track successful vs. failed automation attempts
